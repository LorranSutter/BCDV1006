        <p>Hello! My I'm Lorran. I am undergraduated in Computational Engineering, what sounds similar to Computer Engineering but it is a completly different thing.</p>
        <p>While the second one deals with study and build hardware, my program is focused in computational modeling using, mostly, numerical methods and scientific programming to solve complex real problems.</p>
        <p>I have studied a couple of fields, going throgh fluid mechanics, computer graphics and machine learning applied to stock market.</p>
        <p>I have been already interested in moving to Canada and I have been always interested in disruptive topics. So that is what brought me this program.</p>
        <p>Having some experience with web development, in a close future I see myself as a blockchain developer. More in advance would like to be in a tech lead position of in financial market.</p>
